# ðŸ”— Single PR Updater

Single PR Updater (`TODO: better name`) is a GitHub action meant to be used together with [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to create & update a pull request for every release draft.

## Example

```yaml
jobs:
  release_draft:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run release drafter
        uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v5
        id: release_drafter
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - uses: pyrbin/single-pr-updater@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          label: ðŸš€ release
          head: develop
          base: main
          title: Release ${{ steps.release_drafter.outputs.tag }}
          body: |
            ## [Release ${{ env.RELEASE_TAG }}](${{ steps.release_drafter.outputs.html_url }})
            ${{ steps.release_drafter.outputs.body }}
          draft: false
```

## How it works

Simply put it will query existing PR's by `input.base...input.head`, given label `input.label` & update it's
title & body with given input. If no such PR exist a new one will be created instead.

You can think of `base + head + label` as the identifier.
